## Go-Distributed-GameOfLife

This project implements **Conway's Game of Life** as a **highly scalable, distributed system** using **Go (Golang)**. The primary focus is on achieving **high-performance simulation** across multiple machines using a **Controller/Server/Worker** architecture and Go's native support for network communication via **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**.

This system is designed to distribute the computational load of large-scale grids across several independent nodes (simulated **AWS Nodes**), demonstrating exceptional horizontal scalability.

## Overview

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game whose evolution is determined solely by its initial state. The grid of cells evolves based on simple, local rules:

1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

This project's implementation focuses on distributing these intense computations across multiple remote nodes using the Controller/Server/Worker model to break through the computing power bottleneck of a single machine.

## Final Coursework Report

The full detailed analysis of the distributed implementation, including performance benchmarks and design rationale, is available in the final report.

## System Architecture: Controller-Server-Worker

The simulation logic is split into three main, network-connected components—the **Local Controller** and the **Remote Engine (Server/Worker)**—to maximise performance and scalability.

### Overall Distributed System Architecture

This diagram illustrates the full distributed setup, showing the **Local Controller** managing **I/O** and **SDL** locally, and communicating with the **GOL Workers** hosted on remote **AWS Nodes** via a dotted line representing the network connection.

| Component | Role in Distributed System | Key Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local Controller (Distributor/Client)** | **Orchestrates the system**, handles user input/visualization (SDL), initiates **RPC calls** to remote Workers, collects calculation results, and **aggregates them** into the global world state. | Go, SDL, RPC Client |
| **Engine (Remote Server)** | Deployed on **AWS nodes**. Receives RPC requests via **`RunServer`**, holds the core GOL calculation logic (`DoWork`), and returns the results. | Go, RPC Server/Client, Goroutines |
| **GOL Worker (Compute Logic)** | The calculation logic within the Engine. It calculates the GOL logic for its assigned board **slice (shard)** using **Goroutines** for internal parallelism. | Go, Goroutines (internal parallelism) |

> **Note on Broker Role:** In the current implementation, the **Local Controller** handles the scheduling and result aggregation roles. A dedicated Broker component for managing worker pools and fault tolerance was part of the original design, but is functionally handled by the Controller.

## Key Features & Implementation Highlights

### 1\. High-Performance Distributed Core

  * **RPC Communication:** All communication between the Controller and the Server is handled via **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)**, ensuring reliable command and data transfer over the network.
  * **Workload Partitioning:** The global board is divided evenly by `ImageHeight` into multiple regions (**shards**), and each remote Server/Worker calculates its assigned row shard.
  * **Halo Data Transmission:** To correctly compute boundary cells, the **Halo (boundary data)** (`HaloUpper`, `HaloLower`) is explicitly defined and sent from the Controller to the Workers with each request. This prevents complex neighbour communication between remote Workers, simplifying the design.
  * **RPC Structures:** Communication relies on defined RPC structures:
      * **`WorkerRequest`:** Carries initial parameters (e.g., `StartY`, `Height`, `World`, `HaloUpper`, `HaloLower`) from the Controller to the Worker.
      * **`WorkerResponse`:** Holds the calculated results from the Worker, returning the calculated area status through `Result[][]byte`.

### 2\. Event-Driven Control and Reporting

The Local Controller manages all inputs and outputs via dedicated Goroutines and an event-driven model.

#### Controller and SDL Visualisation Flow

The Controller orchestrates real-time feedback and user interaction via the SDL component, handling keypresses and dispatching various events such as `AliveCellsCount` (for real-time metrics) and `StateChange` (for pause/resume).

#### I/O and PGM Output

The dedicated I/O component handles all file reading and writing (PGM format), communicating with the Controller using specific commands and providing output for testing.

### 3\. Solved Implementation Challenges

The core distributed architecture was successfully established within the **`StartDistributed{}`** function in the distributor:

  * **Controller-Server Connection:** The Controller successfully connects to remote Servers using `rpc.Dial` and executes remote functions via `client.call()`.
  * **Boundary Cell Dependency:** The issue of boundary cells missing neighbouring rows was solved by embedding the **`HaloUpper`** and **`HaloLower`** data within the `WorkerRequest` for every turn's calculation.

## Performance and Scalability

The distributed architecture is optimised for **horizontal scaling**. Benchmarks were conducted on a 20-core Linux machine using a $512 \times 512$ grid over 1000 turns.

  * **Network Overhead:** Initially, running time **significantly increased** compared to the single-machine parallel implementation due to the time loss caused by calling remote Workers (network latency).
  * **Scaling Proof:** As the number of Workers increased, the running time for completing the Life Game **significantly decreased**, confirming the effectiveness of horizontal distribution.
  * **Stabilisation:** As the number of Workers continued to increase, the improvement in running time became smaller and eventually **stabilised** due to increasing network and aggregation overhead.

The chart below illustrates the speedup achieved by distributing the workload:

| Workers Number | Runtime (s) (Approx. from Chart) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | \~210 |
| 2 | \~120 |
| 3 | \~90 |
| 4 | \~70 |
| 5 | \~55 |
| 6 | \~45 |

### Initial State Example

The simulation starts from an initial PGM image representing the live and dead cells on the grid.
